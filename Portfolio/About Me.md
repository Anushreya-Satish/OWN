👋🏻 Hello my name is Anushreya Satish.
 I am a standard 8th student.
 I'm 12 years old and my birthday comes on 1st March.
 My passion is coding and I want to be a Software Engineer in the future. 
 I am big admirer of Paris, it's my dream city. 
 Some people also call me Eiffel Tall as I'm too tall. 
 I am also a guitarist & a pianist. I am a very big fan of a show "Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir" and in this show Adrien Agreste who is also Cat Noir is my favorite.
 I like making Miraculous fanarts. 
 Currently I'm working on a big game idea of mine.
 The name of the game is "The Battle of Miraculous". 
 It is coming soon. I also know a little French and I'm learning it. 
 I know languages like Javascript, HTML, CSS, C#, JSON and a little of PYTHON in programming . 
 I have used code.org , p5 editor, VS Code, Codepen, Replit and Unity Editor.
